      <h1>Thomas Keith Settle</h1>
      <p>An electrical engineer by education, I made the switch to IT-related work about 5 yrs
        into my career. I've done a bit of everything in the corporate IT space, including
        lots of coding in Visual Studio, lots of DB design and development with SQL platforms,
        hiring and leading developers, architecture and design, consulting, training, etc.
      </p>
      <p>But, and this is a big but, probably 99% of my hands-on experience over the years
        has been with fat-client or embedded systems rather than web apps--particularly MVC.
        I've designed MVC apps and built DB infrastructure under them, but I've always had
        web developers doing the UI. I've made minor additions and changes, but I want to
        understand this tech stack at a deeper level. And because I recently left the
        corporate world, I finally have the time to do that.

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span style="color:red">Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
